# Test task for Flymble by Andrey Ivanov

Hello! Hope you're doing well! This is my finished test-task. in order to run it - `npm install` and then `npm start`

I used typescript with `noImplicitAny: true`, `strictNullChecks: true`. Didn't really have much time for the design, so I kept it simple (yet responsive). Some hooks and functional components included. Hope you'll enjoy!
